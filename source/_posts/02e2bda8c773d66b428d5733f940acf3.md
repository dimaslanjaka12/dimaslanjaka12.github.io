This is actually quite natural How to get backlinks to raise rankings in Google search engine seems to still be a lot of people confusion. This is actually quite natural because in 2013 alone there are so many algorithm updates that resulted in many outstanding issues that "backlinks are not needed". 
This is something wrong, backlinks are still a very powerful determinant factor in the Google algorithm. Even if there is a blog that says they can master the keywords with new articles without backlinks, in fact it is not new. From 2012 alone is like that, it's just because they do not pay attention so that euphoria is not clear.  
What new buddy bloggers need to know, even though the article pages have not been given backlinks, but an article page can get a "greeting" reputation from the domain, so without being given even a backlink can enter the first page of Google .... 
It's just still need to be seen again, how hard the competition from these keywords. If the competition is light, then be the champion 1 can also be without backlink ....  
Then why should we get backlinks?
Because generally low-competition keywords do not have large traffic. If the traffic is not large, then our blog will not have commercial value. Surely this is not a problem for those who do blogging for fun only. But for those of you who do blogging for money, then of course the visitor's traffic needs to be .... 
So that's where the domino effect, where there is no backlink, then no rank, and no rank equals no traffic, no traffic means non commercial, and non-commercial means no money coming.  
So Begin Finding Backlinks For Your Blog / Site!
To get a backlink you can do it yourself or hire a backlink service. So here I want to introduce first the ways that you can do yourself ....  
LOOKING FOR YOUR OWN BACKLINK
But before you go, you should be able to distinguish the blogs dofollow and nofollow. For that you must install nodofollow in your firefox browser. So you should first read how to create and know dofollow blog. (Do not use chrome for this backlink search activity)  
Getting Backlinks By Commenting on Dofollow Blogs
This is the oldest technique in which you can tether a backlink by commenting on dofollow blogs. To do this you simply do a search on Google keyword BLOG DOFOLLOW LIST 2014. After that you can get a backlink by commenting on using NAME / URL or OPEN ID. Enter your targeted keywords in the NAME column and the link in the URL column.  
The disadvantage of this method is, generally the page points of this blog is low, so you have to comment a lot. In addition many bloggers "fraudsters" who say they dofollow blog when nofollow, so use nodofollow that you have previously installed to find out if it is true dofollow blog. 
Finding Backlink From Dofollow Social Bookmark
Social bookmark dofollow is a highly recommended backlink source . So for a lightweight competition you can submit each of your articles to several social bookmarking sites. This will make the level of indexing your blog getting better. 
The most popular social bookmarks today are those that use the DRIGG platform. Unfortunately social bookmarking of this kind mostly have "closed registration". So please googling friends first social bookmark that still works .... Who knows anyone who has a list of the latest dofollow social bookmarking . Because at this time my list contains social bookmarking that most have become garbage.  
The only live list below is that most of the keywords can only be non-rich and not targeted. Who has an excess list can share for friends here via facebook comment below.

Finding Relevant Backlinks from free blog websites.
Create a willing to install relevant backlinks, then make a blog dummy or relevant blog is one way. There are many sites where you can create your own pages. The advantage of utilizing these sites is the diversity of IP addresses of their servers so it will look very natural without you having to shell out to pay for any server.  
Here are some free blog service providers that you can use. In addition to this there are still some others. Please try it yourself: 

http://wordpress.com
http://www.sosblogs.com/
http://blogger.com/
http://tumblr.com/
http://weebly.com/
http://blog.com/
http://bravenet.com/
http://www.jimdo.com/
If anyone is confused how to use the blogs for free above, maybe can googling first how to use it.   
Hunting Backlinks By Peeking Backlinks of Famous Blogs or Participants of SEO Contests
Well the problem of the two methods above (social bookmarking and classified ads) is a backlink page that you get really fresh and very low points. If you want to get backlinks are relatively high points, then it is advisable to peek backlinks from famous blogs or blogs that are following the SEO contest. 
Just visit backlinkwatch.com and enter the famous blog URL or the page URL of the completed SEO contest participants. Then you will get a row of URL lines. Are all these URLs dofollow? Of course not, you still have to filter and try one by one to find the dofollow.  
Using Footprint in looking for dofollow backlinks
Another technique is the footprint. Each dofollow blog has its own characteristics. It can be a phrase or sentence that appears on every page. Therefore we can look for other domains that use the same platform using the footprint technique. 
This is a technique for intermediate bloggers, so maybe beginners will be a bit confused. For beginners you should first read the Google Search Operator article, before starting this Footprint practice to find backlinks.   
LOOKING FOR BACKLINK WITH BACKLINK SERVICES
For those of you novice bloggers this way is not recommended, because the backlink skills is something you have to learn, and master. This solution I just recommend to those businessmen who try to build an online site, but do not have enough time due to business busy offline. In other words the time used to find backlinks will be much more produce if used to manage offline business.  
So by hiring a backlink service, you can keep working offline while watching the improved ranking of your website from time to time. Of course you can not ask someone to do a job without a service fee, so please find a backlink service that suits your current budget. Please Googling with BACKLINK SERVICE keyword. 
Here I also want to recommend my friend, who is also the admin of this blog to help you find backlink. After I persuaded long enough (-_-) Fritz finally want to also open a special backlink services of these businessmen. Please check Fritz's offer on the cheap backlink service page he created. 
Ok, that's the solution. Please friends start struggling to find the backlink so that your blog ranking can increase. <hr/> [THIS SITE IS MIRROR](https://www.webmanajemen.com/2017/09/how-to-get-backlinks-to-increase-ranking.html) || <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2017/09/how-to-get-backlinks-to-increase-ranking.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Skip to Full Contents (Read More)</a> <hr/>
