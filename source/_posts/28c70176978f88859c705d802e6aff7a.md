But I remember that I also working with Laravel and in How to remove index.php?route= common issue from url bar for SEO url

    I Also have the same problem and any that I found not solved my problem. But!     I remember that I also working with Laravel and in this engine well working     url path. Don't ask why I associated OpenCart with Laravel. So I enable SEO     radio button in System -> Settings -> Server you also can     disable it I don't see difference in the site work. 
    This solution consist from several part: 
    1.    In your root folder replace .htaccess file content with next     shapshot: 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
        Options -MultiViews -Indexes
    </IfModule>
    RewriteEngine On
    # Handle Authorization Header
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
    # Redirect Trailing Slashes If Not A Folder...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
    RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,R=301]
    # Handle Front Controller...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?route=$1 [L]
</IfModule>
    2.    Go to /system/library/url.php and find link method     and replace it with next: 
public function link($route, $args = '', $secure = false) {
  if ($this->ssl && $secure) {
    $url = $this->ssl . 'index.php?route=' . $route;
  } else {
    $url = $this->url . 'index.php?route=' . $route;
  }
  if ($args) {
    if (is_array($args)) {
      $url .= '&amp;' . http_build_query($args);
    } else {
      $url .= str_replace('&', '&amp;', '&' . ltrim($args, '&'));
    }
  }
  foreach ($this->rewrite as $rewrite) {
    $url = $rewrite->rewrite($url);
  }
  $url = str_replace('index.php?route=', '', $url);
  return $url; 
}
    Since you changed .htaccess in root folder and change url     generating method you also need remember about admin part. If you what see pretty url in admin just    copy .htaccess from root folder to /admin folder. 
If you want save orignal url in admin side you must little bit change    link method with next: 
public function link($route, $args = '', $secure = false) {
  if ($this->ssl && $secure) {
    $url = $this->ssl . 'index.php?route=' . $route;
  } else {
    $url = $this->url . 'index.php?route=' . $route;
  }
  if ($args) {
    if (is_array($args)) {
      $url .= '&amp;' . http_build_query($args);
    } else {
      $url .= str_replace('&', '&amp;', '&' . ltrim($args, '&'));
    }
  }
  foreach ($this->rewrite as $rewrite) {
    $url = $rewrite->rewrite($url);
  }
  //  Skip admin path
  if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], '/admin') !== 0) {
    $url = str_replace('index.php?route=', '', $url);
  }
  return $url; 
}
    Result:
    Before
            http://YOUR_SITE/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=52     
    After
    http://YOUR_SITE/product/product&product_id=52
    Before
    http://YOUR_SITE/index.php?route=account/login
    After
    http://YOUR_SITE/account/login <hr/> [THIS SITE IS MIRROR](https://www.webmanajemen.com) Skip to Full Contents <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2019/09/remove-indexphproute-from-opencart.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a> <hr/>
