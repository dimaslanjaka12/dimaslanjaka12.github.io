For my
companion who utilizes HTML 5 and attempt to enter a space with the codes
and nbsp; or a non-breaking space, it would get a mistake message that way,
so it jumped out at me that attempting to enter the space in a few sections
of this blog page hehe


Why Error Appears Like it?
Since HTML 5 has no support DTD again


How to Solve the error code it how?
Wrote really simple, you just need to change the code of & nbsp; with
another entity that is & # 160; or & # xA0; so the code will not
reproduce the error message was
or if my friend had intended to replace all the codes & nbsp;
automatically as a whole, could enter the following code :

<!DOCTYPE html [ <!ENTITY nbsp "&#160;"> ]> 
Or you can also enter the following DTD

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> 
The second code will automatically fix errors Error The entity 'nbsp' was
referenced, but not declared in the code buddies without having to replace
one by one.

And here I include a link to my friend who wants to know more about this
