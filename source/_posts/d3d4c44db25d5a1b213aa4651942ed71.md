so to see it this way because this way berdsarkan my own experience and has  been tested at the ITB and IPB. huh :) but you do not need to be too  serious because of how extremely easy. 

  Lets you copy the tag below  

<b: if cond = 'data: blog.pageType == & quot; error_page &  quot;'> <meta content = "noindex, nofollow 'name =' robots '/>  <meta content =" noindex, nofollow' name = 'Googlebot' /> </ b:  if> 

  then Paste under the <head>  
  Save Template  



Furthermore, you have to do is wait a day and check back url error. if   there is a rest please delete itself because it only removes the tag   urls indexed Blum error. so if there are remaining error that means the   url that is already indexed.
