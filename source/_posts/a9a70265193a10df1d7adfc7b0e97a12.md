Actually out there are many free services that can be used. But here I prefer doPDF. Besides its use is quite easy to program is not too heavy, and of course free. 
If my friend wishes to convert document to pdf friend can use this software. 
Can of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, WordPad or NotePad.

When finished installing my friend can try. 
 Can via Start - Programs >> - >> doPDF - >> then click on doPDF. Use the search button to select the file you want to convert. Then click create to convert a document to PDF - >> Ok. 
 Or it could be a way to first open the document that want to mate the conversion to PDF. 
 Open Document - file >> - >> print - >> select doPDF - >> print - >> Ok.
