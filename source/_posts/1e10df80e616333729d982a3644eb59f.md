Activate HTTPS On Custom Domain Blogger








Blogs that have the HTTPS                                                 protocol will look more trusted                                                 and safe for visitors. Of                                                 course this can be a plus for                                                 your blog.                                                 
By default, Google provides                                                 free HTTPS services for all                                                 blogs created under the                                                 auspices of Blogspot / Blogger.                                                 Only this service is active if                                                 the blog is still using a                                                 default subdomain, for example                                                 namadomain.blogspot.com                                                 
If you are already using                                                                                                     custom domain alias TLD                                                     (Top Level Domain)                                                                                                 like .com, .net, .id, etc.,                                                 this service automatically can                                                 not be used again. This is                                                 clearly listed in the Blogspot                                                 setting itself.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                
How dong?                                                 
Do not worry. It turns out                                                 still can                                                                                                     plug and activate HTTPS                                                     (SSL) in Blogspot custom                                                     domain                                                                                                 . We will use free SSL from                                                 Cloudflare. To make it easy, I                                                 use screenshots for each of the                                                 steps.                                                 

                                                    1. Setting DNS to                                                     Cloudflare                                                 
I assume you have a Cloudflare                                                 account and custom domain                                                 settings there (CNAME and A                                                 Name). For those still setting                                                 DNS elsewhere, immediately move                                                 to Cloudflare. Why? Yes because                                                 we get SSL from Cloudflare. If                                                 you do not understand how to                                                 custom domain settings in                                                 Cloudflare, googling aja. Lots                                                 of tutorials. But                                                                                                     the HTTPS tutorial in the                                                     custom domain Blogger                                                                                                 has not been much. So I wrote                                                 this article: D

This is the main step here.                                                 Ikutin yes, I've tried to                                                 explain in detail.

How,                                                 easy right? But wait, there are                                                 some things that must be                                                 considered from the use of this                                                 SSL.

Mixed Content                                                
There is the possibility of                                                 Mixed Content (mixing between                                                 HTTP and HTTPS) resulting in                                                 some images or scripts not                                                 being able to run properly. To                                                 fix this, you can change the                                                 URL of the image and the script                                                 was originally http to https.                                                 
                                                    Check the URL of Script and                                                     Image                                                                                                 
Check the URL of the script you                                                 installed. If the URL is still                                                 http, immediately change to                                                 https.                                                 
Check each article and make                                                 sure all image URLs are changed                                                 to https. Pegel indeed. But for                                                 maximum results, why not.

Make all blog indexes become                                                 https. For that you have to                                                 re-submit the sitemap to Google                                                 Webmaster. Do not let your blog                                                 index there are two, namely                                                 http and https. Later Google                                                 confused.                                                 
Maybe that's what I can write.                                                 If there is a shortage and                                                 input please write in the                                                 comment field yes. Let this                                                 blog can continue introspection                                                 and growing: D<hr/> <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2017/07/simple-way-to-install-and-enable-https.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a>
