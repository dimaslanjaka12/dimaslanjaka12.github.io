A few days ago I idly googling the keywords"Best Blog in Indonesia"
After I check one by one from the first page to page ten in Google, the average contents are the same. A list of the best blogs in Indonesia if it is not on the blog, most of the SEO and online businesses.
Why is that, Bro?
Most bloggers assess the popularity of a blog only from Alexa ranking. Though the name is Alexa totally inaccurate. Perhaps for rank 1 to 500 is still arguably accurate, but if it is above 500, it can not be used as a reference for popularity of a blog.
Blog that discusses blogs, SEO, and online businesses, tend to have a low Alexa ranking for average visitors a blogger. How come?because most bloggers installed the Alexa toolbar on your browser.
As my friend knows, the Alexa toolbar is one tool used by Alexa to determine the ranking of a website.
Now therefore, in this post I want to display a list of the best blogs in Indonesia that I value is not based on the ranking of Alexa, but based on the originality of the content, quality of content, number of followers on social media, and the age of the blog.
Also below I show the source of income of each blog. Source of income is only an estimate, so it can be properly and could also be wrong.

Cover…
That is a list of the best blogs in Indonesia Mas Sugeng version. List blog above most I got from a recommendation of friends on facebook . I thank you very much for those who are giving recommendations.
In addition to all 12 blogs above, I am sure there are many other blogs that did not lose cool in Indonesia. Please understand if not all of my input into the list because I do not have enough time to assess all the blogs that exist in Indonesia.
Why no one is the topic of SEO, blog tutorials, and online businesses
Because I want to change the mindset of a beginner blogger, that in order to create a popular blog does not need to create a blog that talks about blogs, SEO, blog tutorials, and online businesses. <hr/> Skip to Full Contents <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2017/04/12-best-blog-in-indonesia-in-various.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a> <hr/>
