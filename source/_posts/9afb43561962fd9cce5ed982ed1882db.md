  I know this is an older issue, but I recently had the same problem and was   having issues resolving it, despite attempting the DisplayUnlockCaptcha   fix. This is how I got it alive.   
  Firstly you must activate less secure apps at https://myaccount.google.com/security?hl=en          Enable less secure apps    
  Head over to Account Security Settings (       https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps     ) and enable "Access for less secure apps", this allows you to use the   google smtp for clients other than the official ones.   
  
                Enable less secure apps      
  
  Update  
  Google has been so kind as to       list     all the potential problems and fixes for us. Although I recommend trying   the       less secure apps setting     . Be sure you are applying these to the correct account.   
  
    
      
        If you've turned on 2-Step Verification for your account, you might         need to enter an                   App password                 instead of your regular password.       
      
        Sign in to your account from the web version of Gmail at                   https://mail.google.com                 . Once you’re signed in, try signing in         
        to the mail app again.       
      
        Visit                   http://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha                 and sign in with your Gmail username and password. If asked, enter         the         
        letters in the distorted picture.       
      
                            Continue                                    Success, now run your smtp again              
      
        Your app might not support the latest security standards. Try         changing a few settings to                   allow less secure apps                 access to your account.       
      
        Make sure your mail app isn't set to check for new email too often.         If your mail app checks for new messages more than once every 10         
        minutes, the app’s access to your account could be blocked.
