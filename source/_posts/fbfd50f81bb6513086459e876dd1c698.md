# NODEJS OPTIONS [ NODE_OPTIONS ]

Node.js accompanies an assortment of CLI choices. These choices uncover worked in investigating, different ways of executing scripts, and other accommodating runtime choices.

To see this documentation as a manual page in a terminal, run 'man hub'. [Read more](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html)

## How to setup multiple options on GitHub Workflow
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build www.webmanajemen.com
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      NODE_OPTIONS: "--experimental-vm-modules --max_old_space_size=8192"
```

## How to performance run nodejs on low devices
The recommended amounts for a "low memory device".

for 32-bit and/or Android are:
```shell
node --max-executable-size=96 --max-old-space-size=128 --max-semi-space-size=1 app.js
```
for 64-bit non-android are:
```shell
node --max-executable-size=192 --max-old-space-size=256 --max-semi-space-size=2 app.js
```
These above codes would limit the heap totals to 225mb and 450mb respectively. It doesn't include memory usage outside JS. For instance buffers are allocated as "c memory" , not in the JavaScript heap.

### Flags
- `--max-executable-size` the maximum size of heap reserved for executable code (the native code result of just-in-time compiled JavaScript).
- `--max-old-space-size` the maximum size of heap reserved for long term objects
- `--max-semi-space-size` the maximum size of heap reserved for short term objects<hr/> <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/NodeJS/node-options.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a>
