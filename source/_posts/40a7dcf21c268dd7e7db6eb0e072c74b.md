Install PHP Web Server on Termux



     Install PHP Web Server on Termux 
 connect the previous article about how to install maria db in termux ( Install MariaDB on Termux ), as a complement we will install the apache web server in termux .  due to the differences in termux compared to native Linux, the default ports for web servers like 80 etc cannot be used, so later we will use other ports to run the web server . 
 
 Install Apache WEb server 
 to install Apache web server is quite easy, just type 
  #apt install Apache2 
 wait until the process is complete, if it's already running it it's easy enough.  all we need to do is type the command. 
  #php -S ip: port -t /path/to/web/file.php 
 where ip is the ip address of the web that we want, the port is the port we want to use as an http port, if by chance port 80 is not used it can use port 80, and /path/to/web/file.php is the directory of the php file that we want to run. 
 suppose I have a file at /sdcard/www/html/index.php.  then the ip address of my cellphone on the WLAN network is 192.168.1.200 and I want to use port 8080 as the port just type 
  #php -S 192.168.1.200:8080 -t / sdcard / www / html / index.php  
 to try it just type in the android browser localhost / index.php or if you happen to be connected to the network can use the direct ip address 192.168.1.200, and try accessing it from another cellphone or computer.  if it happens to not have a LAN / Wifi network then ip can be filled with 127.0.0.1. 
 maybe this is what I can share , in the next article I will discuss about ssh server in termux, so we can tamper with console thermux directly using the ssh server .  it can even be used for debugging when we develop applications on Android.
