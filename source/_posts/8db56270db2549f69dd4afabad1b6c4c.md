Install Ubuntu on an Android phone 
    
        
            
                
                                    
            
        
    
    
        after struggling finally managed to also install Ubuntu on my beloved         android phone. the installation is easy, the hard one is to download         it, make it like that.breaking up disconnecting disconnects, once it         breaks it can't be resumed , if you want to download        , it must be dawn, the speed is still god ðŸ˜€ * Pffftttt ðŸ˜‚     
    
        INSTALLATION    
    
        
            Ok, proceed to the first stage, which must be downloadedis the Image file from Ubuntu that has been            remastered using X-Window LXDE. 3.5 GB file size is quite something for the internet in Indonesia, files can be downloaded at            http://minus.com/mKGww7gIl#2 . the form is a Zip file and if extracted it will produce 3ubuntu.img, ubuntu.sh, and the            ubuntu.sh.md5 files . if you have downloaded the file then there are some software that must be prepared, first isTerminal Emulator , Busybox and            Android VNC , all three can be downloaded            at the android market for free. install and we proceed to the next             stage.         
        
            The Android must be rooted.        
        
            Copy the ubuntu.img, ubuntu.sh and ubuntu.sh.md5 files to a folder             on your Android HP SD Card, make sure it's in one folder, let's say             the folder is "Ubuntu".         
        
            if you have already opened the terminal emulator ,             type #su to become root.         
        
            #cd sdcard / ubuntu /            to enter the ubuntu folder that we created earlier on the SD Card.         
        
            last type #sh ubuntu.sh        
        
            let the warning appear. wait a while, ubuntu is being booted on             your android phone, of course this depends on the specifications of             your cellphone, if I use the Samsung Galaxy S so it's OK to run the             Ubuntu.         
    
    
                                    
            Running Terminal         
    
    
                                    
            Ubuntu Boot Up         
    
    
        HOW TO RUN    
    
        
if you are already out of the terminal emulator, but don'texit , leave the Terminal Emulator running, then open            Android VNC , enter the parameters as follows:         
        
            Address: localhost (or leave it blank).         
        
            Password: Ubuntu         
        
            Port: 5900         
        
            BPP: 24         
        
            press connect and enjoy enjoying ðŸ˜€         
    
    
                                
    
        HOW TO GET OUT AND UNINSTALL    
    
        
            To exit the Ubuntu Operating System, please log out of Android VNC.         
        
then from the Terminal Emulator that was still open, type#exit three times followed by            enter , leave it long enough until the entire             Ubuntu OS is shut down.         
        
            and finished, just to uninstall it just delete the ubuntu folder:             D.         
    
    
        Here are some screenshots that I get when running the application on         Ubuntu LXDE ðŸ˜€

            Gimp Photo Editor application is common on Ubuntu         
    
    
                                    
            Gimp is running again         
    
    
                                    
            Open Office again Start Up         
    
    
                                    
            Open Office Draw         
    
    
                                
    
        Warning, because running Ubuntu requires a large amount of resources, I         don't have to be responsible if until the HP situ modar, please try         with your own risk: D. and one more don't do # apt-get update or         install application here, indeed it's okay, but this ubuntu is Ubuntu         that has been made so that it can run on Android Device, if it's         updated yes your Android address will be super slow .
