In addition to alphanumeric characters, sometimes we need             to write special characters into HTML, for example, the sign "<". Character brackets"<" can not simply be written in            HTML, because the character brackets internal             functioning as a sign of an opening in HTML tags.             In the HTML text tutorial this time, we will learn                              how to display and enter special characters into HTML                          .         

            How to Insert Special Characters in HTML         
To insert special characters into HTML,we must Men- 'escape' characters. The term            escape meant that from the writing of a character             directly, we can replace itwith a number or reference that             refers to the characters.         
In HTML, there are two ways for Men-            'escape' character, by using the             numbering of figures (numeric entity),and using             the abbreviation for the character (named entity).Either way, it is written with the character            '&' at the beginning of the writing, and ends             with the characters'; '.         
For example, if I want to write the character            "<" in the HTML content, the writing is as             follows:         
  I'm learning to ask the characters & # 060;  in HTML 
Way above using numbering numbers ornumeric entity. The character "<" has anumeric entity            60, so written as & # 060;.        
If using abbreviations characters ornamed entity, the character "<" is written into            & lt; as follows:         
  I'm learning to show the character of & lt;  in HTML 

            Special Characters in HTML table         
In addition to the characters "<",            HTMLprovides hundreds of special characters that             can be used. Here is a table of special characters commonly used:         
                
For a complete list of special characters in HTML,            you can see it on the Web Standards Project's website at                             www.webstandards.org/learn/reference/charts/entities/                     
In closing, here is an example of HTMLcode that             will display some special characters in HTML:         

  <! DOCTYPE html>
 <Html>
 <Head>
 <Title> Learn HTML in Duniailkom </ title>
 </ Head>
  <Body>
 <H3> I'm learning HTML & copy;  Duniailkom.com & # 174;  & Trade; </ h3>
 <P> In this tutorial, we will learn to display
 special characters such as & lt ;, & # 062 ;, & hellip; </ p>
 </ Body>
  </ Html> 
                                    

                                        

One of the characters is important to note is the character of'non-breaking space', which is written as                & nbsp; This character serves to ensure                 that the phrases or words are not separate.
                If I wrote:                 
  World & nbsp; CS 
The word will be shown a web browser intothe World CS (characters                    & nbsp; will be displayed as space),                     but the second word would be'considered' as a                     whole, and will not separate even in the end of the line or                     reduced the size of the web browser. <hr/> Skip to Full Contents <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2017/04/how-to-display-and-entering-special.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a> <hr/>
