# NOT, AND, OR Declaration Function in Blogger Conditional Tags
In using the blogger conditional tag, we can also provide a declaration function on the conditional tag to make it shorter

## NOT
In the use of the blogger conditional tag if it is **NOT** the page in question, which means the code will **NOT** be displayed on the page in question. Add function ! (exclamation mark)
```xml

```
or
```xml

```

## AND
In blogger conditional tag use Condition if both are true. Add `AND` function
```xml

```

## OR
condition if one of them is true. Add `OR` function
```xml

```
**Addition :**
To concatenate multiple page urls on a specific page tag. If the code like no.11 above is only 1 url, then for multiple urls:
```xml

```
Notice there is a **comma**. On the other hand you can use and, which means that if the use of both or more conditions is true it will be displayed. If one is not correct then it will not be displayed.

Thus a collection of blogger conditional tag codes that I can show you all, good luck and happy experimenting.
