Someone ask to stackoverflow like this.
I would prefer to load javascript files solely on Desktop version of my
Google blogspot (blogger.com) since i would like a lightweight version of
my web log for mobile.
I came through followings, however not operating

<b:if cond != 'data:blog.isMobile'>;
<b:if cond = !'data:blog.isMobile'>;
<b:if cond = '!data:blog.isMobile'>;
<b:if cond='data:blog.pageType !== "data:blog.isMobile">

How can I write "is Not Mobile" conditional in Google blogspot? Thanks in
advance for all answers.
Update: I'm using following code at the moment and it's working but better
ideas are welcome

<b:if cond='data:blog.isMobile'>
<b:else/>
    //I include javascript files here and they only appear on desktop version
</b:if>

Here the solved for this problem:
You can be use true or false statements in blogger
conditional tags in this case. This is the perfect way :)

<b:if cond='data:blog.isMobile == &quot;false&quot;'>
//Contents inside this, will only appear in Desktop version.
</b:if>


 Edit #1:
This will work just on the off chance that you have empowered versatile format, and set it to custom.


Furthermore, it works on Chrome's portable emulator. (will be diverted to portable adaptation if going to from a cell phone or with an emulator that mirrors a versatile Program Client Operator. it will include ?m=1 toward the finish of the URL)

Hope this helps.
