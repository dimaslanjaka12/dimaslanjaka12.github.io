            Some free domain provider sites forever
        
How sob have read and practice posting before it? Which inform
            about Hosting unlimited and free domain forever hmm if it is and find problem with its domain fitting really ne I
            want to give info about some free domain provider for your blog and website.
        
Ngomongin about the less obvious domain it feels if we do not understand what is a domain?
        
DOMAIN is our website or blog address. Domain used to facilitate visitors to
            remember the address of our blog / website. Therefore, we need to
            have a domain name that is easy to remember.
        
The core domain is the name of the blog or website address that we
            make on the internet, Facebook for your visitors not to stray where
            and show ownership of content on the internet.
        
So how to get a domain?
        
If you use the blogger platform then you will be given a domain
            that ends up there name of blogspot.com example:
            
                http://web-manajemen.blogspot.com
            
        
If in wordpress will be like:
            
                https://dimaslanjaka.wordpress.com
            
        
It can be spelled out also with domain hosted property of a
platform to create a blog or website and if the            domain selfhost or tld like what min?
        
Domain TLD usually must be purchased first site hosting provider
            usually have hostinger, rumahweb, niagahoster, bluehost, godaddy,
            qwords, etc.
        
The general price of the tld domain is usually between
            115,000-120,000 depending on who you want .com, .net. Id or
            something.
        
But not infrequently there is also a cheap domain
            in each promo that cost up to 15. 000 an hmm already like buying
            yak beans.
        
Ok we go to the main topic, For you who are bored with domain
            hosted like blogspot.com, wordpress.com and want
            to make your blog / website look more professional without having
