Hello guys, I am making a separate post explaining the utility and
    equipment of each hero upon volumes of requests.


    Original post:


    
        Seven Knight Guide For F2P
    


    I figured the other post was getting lengthy, so I made a separate post.
    Thank you for the support and interest you have shown to my previous post.
    This post is largely a work in progress, so please bear with the
    unorganized structure.


    
        In the near future I will be also be making commentaries for each
        heroes so then people would be more aware of why each hero is being
        used where they are.
    


    I will get started right away:


    As I have stated numerous times on my main beginner guide post, remember
    that
    
        even if heroes are listed as "not used," you still need to raise their
        proficiency exp, levels, and attributes eventually. Focus on capping
        the heroes to lv 50 first.
    
Do not fuse hero shards to get upper tier hero shards because    you will need to hit lv 50 on ALL heroes! If you've done
    that, then it is okay to fuse. Just know that level caps are also
    increasing to 56 eventually.

        Heroes that can be used in Scenario can also work as a raid dps/ranged
        hero.
