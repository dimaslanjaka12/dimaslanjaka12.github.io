        Understanding async attributes

        Definition and Usage     
The async attribute is a boolean attribute.         
When present, it specifies that the script will be executed             asynchronously as soon as it is available.         
Note:            The async attribute is only for external scripts (and should only             be used if the src attribute is present).         

                Understanding Defer Attribute             

                Definition and Usage             
The defer attribute is a boolean attribute.             
When present, it specifies that the script is executed when the                 page has finished parsing.             
Note:                The defer attribute is only for external scripts (should only                 be used if the src attribute is present).             
Note:                There are several ways an external script can be executed:             

                    If async is present: The script is executed asynchronously                     with the rest of the page (the script will be executed                     while the page continues the parsing)                 
                    If async is not present and defer is present: The script is                     executed when the page has finished parsing                 
                    If neither async or defer is present: The script is fetched                     and executed immediately, before the browser continues                     parsing the page                 



This time I share auto defer images to wordpress and blogger.     

Lets following tutorial:

This is builded from jQuery functions, it automatically generated         base64 encoding. Then grabbing the "src" value to be encoded and put         origins on "data-src".     
Now I have 2 type codes for this two blog platforms (wordpress and         blogger). I had included/maked "unminified" and "minified" of codes.         Choose one them put in before the </ body> html tag.     
        Here's this code:     

        WordPress (unminified)     

  <Script>
 $ ( "Img"). Each (function () {
 $ (This) .attr ( "Data-src", $ (this) .attr ( "src"));
 $ (This) .attr ( "src", the "data: image / png; base64, R0lGODlhAQABAAD / ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs =")}
 );
 function init () {
 var e = document.getElementsByTagName ( "img");
 for (var t = 0; t <e.length; t ++) {
 if (e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src")) {
 e [t] .setAttribute ( "src", e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src"))}
 }
 }
 window.onload = init;
 </ Script>


        WordPress (minified)     

  <Script> $ ( "img"). Each (function () {$ (this) .attr ( "Data-src", $ (this) .attr ( "src")); $ (this) .attr ( " src ", the" data: image / png; base64, R0lGODlhAQABAAD / ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs = ")}); function init () {var e = document.getElementsByTagName (" img "); for (var t = 0; t <e.length ; t ++) {if (e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src")) {e [t] .setAttribute ( "src", e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src"))}}} window .onload = init; </ script> 

        Blogger (unminified)     

  <Script type = "text / javascript">
 // <! [CDATA [
 $ ( "Img"). Each (function () {
 $ (This) .attr ( "Data-src", $ (this) .attr ( "src"));
 $ (This) .attr ( "src", the "data: image / png; base64, R0lGODlhAQABAAD / ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs =")}
 );
 function init () {
 var e = document.getElementsByTagName ( "img");
 for (var t = 0; t <e.length; t ++) {if (e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src")) {e [t] .setAttribute ( "src", e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src"))}}} window.onload = init;  //]]>
 </ Script> 

        Blogger (minified)     

  <Script type = "text / javascript"> // <! [CDATA [$ ( "img"). Each (function () {$ (this) .attr ( "Data-src", $ (this) .attr ( "src")); $ (this) .attr ( "src", the "data: image / png; base64, R0lGODlhAQABAAD / ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs =")}); function init () {var e = document.getElementsByTagName ( "img" ); for (var t = 0; t <e.length; t ++) {if (e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src")) {e [t] .setAttribute ( "src", e [t] .getAttribute ( "Data-src"))}}} window.onload = init;  //]]> </ script> <hr/> [THIS SITE IS MIRROR](https://www.webmanajemen.com) Skip to Full Contents <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2017/04/auto-defer-images-in-blogger-and-wordpress.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a> <hr/>
