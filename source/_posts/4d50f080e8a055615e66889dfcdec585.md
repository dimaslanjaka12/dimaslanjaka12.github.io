    Best Aroma Combination Tips 
The following are tips for combining the best scents so you can get the     maximum buff 
    Woodsy Scent + High Acidity 

random buff from woodsy = dex
random buff from High acidity = Plant gathering
6 dex = 1 plant gathering, so if you get a buff like above it means you get a buff equivalent to 300 ++ dex or a    50 ++ plant gathering
    Woodsy Scent + Fruity Scent 

random buff from woodsy = Dex / Tailor
random buff from Fruity Scent = Sewing / Def Gear Crafting
6 dex = 1 Tailor / Sewing, so if you get a buff like above it means you get a buff equivalent to 300 ++ dex or    Tailor / Sewing 50 ++
    Woodsy Scent + Bitter Taste 

Random buff from Woodsy = Weapon Crafting
random buff from Bitter Taste = Str
6 STR = 1 Weapon Crafting, so if you get a buff like above it means you get a buff equal to    300 ++ STR or Weapon Crafting 50 ++
    
            Perfect STR / AGI + DEX + END buff pvp         
can? it can be really great but the process of making it will             definitely be very long because it requires all the aroma of Woodsy             + Bitter + flower with lv 4/5 and very high luck so that the stat             comes out.         
            Tips for making a new aroma (woodsy, Bitter, Fruity, Flower)         
You can make new scents from 3 basic scents, namely high acidity,             soft pulp and high sugar content         
abbreviation:         
            
                    High Acidity = A                                         Soft pulp = P                                     
                    High Sugar Content = S                                         Woodsy scent = W                                     
                    Bitter Taste = B                                         Fruity Scent = F                                     
                    Flowery = FL                                                         
        
            Tips for Making a Woodsy Scent         
        
to make woodsy scents require high- lv high fruit buff buffs + low             level soft pulp .         
based on experiments, I usually use the total scent formula = lv 10             for example         
4A1P + 4A1P = TOTAL 8A2P = 10         
then what if I combine fruit with high acid lv 3 soft pulp lv 1 as             illustrated above?         
the result is still not 100% successful, it can fail can also             succeed because the total level of fruit is not up to 10 that is         
3A1P + 3A1P = TOTAL 6A2P = 8         
the formula above is the result of my own experiments and you don't have to follow it. What is important to make            WOODSY SCENTis that the fruit must have high high             acidity lv and low level soft pulp.         
The following is a table of experimental results in making my             woodsy Scent         
        
            Tips on Creating a Fruity Scent         
to make the Fruity Scent requires fruit with a high buff sugar             content high lv + low level soft pulp .         
for the formula, I use formulas just like woody scents, only the             main ingredients are fruits with high Sugar Content.         
            Tips for Making Bitter Taste         
to make Bitter taste requires liquid fruit / fruit with high Woodsy             Scent buff + low level soft pulp.         
for the formula I use formulas just like woody scents, although it             isn't always 100% successful maybe because bitter taste is an             advanced level of aroma from woodsy Scent so it seems to have to             use a slightly different formula.         
            Tips for Making a Flowery Scent         
to make Bitter taste need fruit / liquid fruit with high lv Fruity             Scent buff + low level soft pulp .         
for the formula I use formulas just like woody scents, although             it's not always 100% successful maybe because Flowery Scent is a             top-level scent advanced from the Fruity Scent so it seems to have             to use a slightly different formula.

even though the doctrine is less than perfect, I think it's helpful             enough for the durango chefs to be a wine opener, hehehehe ...
