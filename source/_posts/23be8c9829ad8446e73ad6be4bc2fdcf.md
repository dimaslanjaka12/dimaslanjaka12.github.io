How might I make a Cygwin alternate way that will open Cygwin at a particular envelope? This would hinder composing 
cd disc/cygdrive/c/Users/Tom/Desktop/ 
each time I dispatch Cygwin. 

When you introduce Cygwin (or in the event that you've just introduced it, download it   again and begin setup again to run an update), ensure that you select   the chere bundle under the "Shells" classification. 
    After Cygwin is launched, open Cygwin terminal and type command: 
chere -i -t mintty -s bash

    Presently you bought to have "Bash Prompt Here" in the Windows right-click setting   menu. 
    (mintty is     Cygwin's default terminal. If you don't choose it with the -t    option, your "Bash Prompt Here" will use the same terminal as the Windows     Command Prompt, which prevents horizontal resizing.)<hr/> <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2019/06/cygwin-in-context-menus.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a>
