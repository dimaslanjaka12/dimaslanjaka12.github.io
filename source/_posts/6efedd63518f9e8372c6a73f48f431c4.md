You are also an Android Termux, a Linux in Android 
    
You are a Linux lover, like to play with theLinux operating system , accustomed to using theLinux console . You are also an Android user, like        Android . iyup termux is a linux emulator        .said linux emulator because here we can install console-based Linux applications that are like other Linux applications, such asMariaDB Server , Apache Server, FTP Server ,        Samba Server and even SSH Server .     
    
                                    
            I can do Linux commands directly on my cellphone.         
    
    
        termuxis an application and also an emulator, we can        maintain the android we have, do the sudo command         (need root) or even become our cellphone as a mini server for         various purposes. for those who like to use Linux times to test network security, this application is suitable for you, we can install various        security applications that run on the console .for         example I can run htop in termux and the following results.     
    
                                    
            HTOP in termux         
    
    
the point is termux is a complete linux        operating system that has been ported in such a way as to run         on android. the difference with Linux installers on other                     Androids                 (as in my writing                     Install Ubuntu on an Android phone                 ), if the Linux installer on other                     Androids                 on average use the OS itself which will cause very heavy and must be booted every time you want to run, termux uses direct        operating Linuxsystem that is the basis of         Android. so what we change using Termux will also change         Android (because Android is actually a Linux application that         runs on top of the Dalvik Virtual Machine, while Thermux, for         the UX problem he joins Android , but the core system goes         directly to the Android Linux system).     
    
                                   
            MariaDB running server directly from HP. next time I will share how             to setup it.         
    
    
        as I said before, we can install various Linux applications in termux,         for example I installed Maria DB and run it, besides that I         also installed Apache server so I could use the web, and as a         result I have a portable server on my cellphone. then what's         the question for? if by chance you are an IT practitioner working here         and there, here and there, applications like this are quite helpful in         emergencies. maybe next time I will post about how to install it, so         I'll see you in another post, Okey Donkey and welcome to         Website Development Indonesia <hr/> [THIS SITE IS MIRROR](https://www.webmanajemen.com/2018/11/termux-linux-in-android.html) || <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2018/11/termux-linux-in-android.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Skip to Full Contents (Read More)</a> <hr/>
