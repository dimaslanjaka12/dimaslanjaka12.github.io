        clothes that want to be colored     
        dye / black dye     
        bleach / bleach     
To make black clothes, you must first open and learn the dye and bleach     skills in the cooking / cooking skill section, to make bleach items quite     easy because it requires less material, that is dinosaur eggs, although     finding dinosaur eggs is quite difficult because rare. 
next is how to make dye / black dye, to make dye black color requires     cattail material ,cattail can be found on swamp islands or swamp, look for     cattail which has black color and black is better to get black dye, after     getting cattail, The cattail obtained should not be immediately made into a     dye / dye but must be dried and burned first, dried can be done by trimming     the workbench and burned can be done by skewer on a campfire or otherwise,     after finishing, make a dye / dye with cattail that was processed earlier. 

steps for getting black clothes; 

        bleach clothes     
        Mix the nails with dye / black dye     
explanation; 

        bleach first the clothes that want to be colored / changed to black,         using bleach items that have been made. Bleach aims to get the basic         color of the clothes to white so that they get the maximum black         color.(note; you should bleach clothes several times so that you get a         really white base color)     
        after bleached, we color the nail to be mixed with dye or black dye that         has been made beforehand.     
after doing the above process correctly, black clothes will be produced as     we want. 
a few tips for getting the maximum black: 

        bleach clothes several times to get the white base color, at least         twice the mixing process with bleach.     
        use a burnt cattail during the combustion process (skewer) for dye         making     
        use cattail which has RGB color information with values ​​below 30     
        the bleach process does not reduce the processing limit     
        the dye mixing process with clothing reduces the process limit on the         packing.     
        use clothes that can be processed more than 1 time (pictures of 2x or         more hammers that can be seen in the description.     
        if you can't make bleach / dye then get help from other people or         members of your clan who can make it for you.     
so many tutorials and tips on getting black clothes, and finally thanks for     the criticism and suggestions. <hr/> [THIS SITE IS MIRROR](https://www.webmanajemen.com/2018/08/durango-wild-lands-how-to-make-black.html) || <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2018/08/durango-wild-lands-how-to-make-black.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Skip to Full Contents (Read More)</a> <hr/>
