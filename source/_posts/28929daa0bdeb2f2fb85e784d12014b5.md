The async and defer attributes for the <script> element have nice support now, so it’s time to learn exactly what they do!

                <script>                                            
Let's begin by process what <script> with none attributes                 will. The HTML file are parsed till the script file is hit, at                 that time parsing can stop and a call for participation are                 created to fetch the file (if it's external). The script can                 then be dead before parsing is resumed.             
                                        
                <script async>                                            
async downloads the file through out HTML parsing and can pause                 the HTML program to execute it once it'sfinished downloading.             
                                        
                <script defer>                                            
defer downloads the file throughout hypertext markup language                 parsing and can solely execute it once the computer program has                 completed. defer scripts also are guarenteed to execute within                 the order that they seem within the document.             
                                        
                When should I use what?                                             
Typically you would like to use async wherever attainable, then                 defer then no attribute. Here area unit some general rules to                 follow:             

                    If the script is modular and does not rely on any scripts                     then useasync.                 
                    If the script relies upon or is relied upon by another                     script then usedefer.                 
If the script is small and is relied upon by anasync script then use an inlinescript with no attributes placed                    above the async scripts.                 

                Support                                             
IE9 and below have some pretty unhealthy bugs in their                 implementation of defersuch that the execution order isn't                 guarenteed. If you would like to support <= IE9 i like to                 recommend not exploitation defer in the least and embrace your                 scripts with no attribute if the execution order matters.                                     Read the specifics here                                .             

This time I will give functions.php custom to automatically defer or         async javascript (js).     
Function: adding async = "async" for async and defer = "defer" to defer         javascript (js).     

        defer 
  add_defer_attribute function ($ tag, $ handle) {
    // add script handles to the array below
    $ Scripts_to_defer = array ( 'my-js-handle', 'another-handle');
   
    foreach ($ scripts_to_defer as $ defer_script) {
       if ($ defer_script === $ handle) {
          return str_replace ( 'src', 'defer = "defer" src ", $ tags);
       }
    }
    return $ tag;
 } 
  add_filter ( 'script_loader_tag', 'add_defer_attribute', 10, 2); 
    
    async 
  add_async_attribute function ($ tag, $ handle) {
    // add script handles to the array below
    $ Scripts_to_async = array ( 'my-js-handle', 'another-handle');
   
    foreach ($ scripts_to_async as $ async_script) {
       if ($ async_script === $ handle) {
          return str_replace ( 'src', 'async = "async" src ", $ tags);
       }
    }
    return $ tag;
 } 
  add_filter ( 'script_loader_tag', 'add_async_attribute', 10, 2);
