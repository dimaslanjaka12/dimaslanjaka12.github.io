Packages are manually installed via the    dpkg command (Debian Package Management System). dpkg is the backend to commands like    apt-get and aptitude, which in turn are the     backend for GUI install apps like the Software Center and Synaptic. 
    Something along the lines of: 
    dpkg    --> apt-get, aptitude --> Synaptic,     Software Center 
    But of course the easiest ways to install a package would be, first, the     GUI apps (Synaptic, Software Center, etc..), followed by the terminal     commands apt-get and aptitude that add a very     nice user friendly approach to the backend dpkg, including but not limited     to packaged dependencies, control over what is installed, needs update, not     installed, broken packages, etc.. Lastly the dpkgcommand which     is the base for all of them. 
    Since dpkg is the base, you can use it to install packaged directly from     the command line. 
    Install a package 
sudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE

    For example if the package file is called askubuntu_2.0.debthen you should do sudo dpkg -i askubuntu_2.0.deb. Ifdpkg reports an error due to dependency problems, you can run    sudo apt-get install -f to download the missing dependencies     and configure everything. If that reports an error, you'll have to sort out     the dependencies yourself by following for example             How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?         . 
    Remove a package 
sudo dpkg -r PACKAGE_NAME

    For example if the package is called askubuntu then you should     do sudo dpkg -r askubuntu. 
    Reconfigure an existing package 
sudo dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE_NAME

    This is useful when you need to reconfigure something related to said     package. Some useful examples it the keyboard-configurationwhen you want to enable the Ctrl+Alt+    Backspace in order to reset the X server, so you would the     following: 
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

    Another great one is when you need to set the Timezone for a server or your     local testing computer, so you use use the tzdata package: 
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata <hr/> Skip to Full Contents <a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/2018/10/install-deb-package-via-termux.html" rel="follow" class="button" id="read-more">Read More</a> <hr/>
