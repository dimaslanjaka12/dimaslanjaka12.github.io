If you Got this issue today on windows, but don't need to downgrade node, just as discussed on

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58199866)

just need to change some hashes on your project:

`node_modules\react-native\packager\blacklist.js`

  
```javascript
var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[/\\]react[/\\]dist[/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];
```

Change to:

  
```js
var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[\/\\]react[\/\\]dist[\/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];
