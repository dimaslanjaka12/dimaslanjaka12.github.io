<p>However the keywords as it is not a keyword that easily could     just bring a lot of traffic to your blog, because generally     popular keywords that have high levels of high searches are     usually the competition is quite tough, so you should be able     to compete with blogs board who already popular and has a good     authority in the eyes of search engines.    </p>
<p>The following article will explain how the strategy of competing    with blogs top when you select a title with popular keywords that    much demand, so that even though the title of the article that you    make is the title of the article which is very difficult    competition and it is controlled by a blogger on board you are    still likely to get visitors that can increase traffic to your blog    from the article.<br>   Strategy Board Up To Increase traffic<br>When you decide content were the title of the article which has a    disbursement rate is high then the keyword is usually controlled by    a blog board who had already published articles with keywords and    able to dominate search results in the best position, so that the    article’s posting that you make be able to compete there some    technique or strategy you use in order to get traffic from the    title.<br>Some strategies to compete with the top blogs that you can try are    as follows:   </p>
<p>   #1. Create a title with Long Tail Keyword<br>When you know that the keywords that you will use to make the title    of the article has a level of competition is very tough so make the    title of the article is to use        long tail keywords       .<br>How do I make sure that the title that I created has a tough    competition level?<br>The trick is simple, just do a search using the keywords that you    are a target, if the search results are found millions of search    results can be ascertained that these keywords have a tough    competition level.<br>For example example for the keyword   “how to create a blog”, when checked on google    keyword planer, this keyword has the search rate is very    extraordinary (popular keywords), can be seen in the following    figure:   </p>
<p>The key word turned out to have an average number of searches per    month as many as 90,500 searches, no wonder many great blogs to    target this keyword, and indeed after check in keyword search    results at this level of competition is quite tough which is about    6,300,000 the result, as shown in the figure below:   </p>
<p>This means that if targeting these keywords then you have to    compete with other articles 6,200,000.<br>One way that you can rely on to compete with these keywords is    presenting the article title using        long tail keywords       , title long tail keywords will be able to make your article likely    to appear with a variety of relevant keywords so that your articles    will have many opportunities to be found in search results and can    increase traffic to your blog.<br>As explained by internet marketing experts neil patel, how          how to bring in 20,000 visitors in one month         with longtail keywords, states that if you consistently publish     articles with long-tail content and quality are consistent with     the use of the title long tail keywords then you will see an     increase in traffic on the blog you are significan.<br>Likewise, based on research conducted by statista that onpage seo    optimization average successful when it involves long tail keywords    for the title, meaning that when you involve        optimization seo onpage       , in order to get the most out onpage optimization then you can    involve titles that use long tail keywords.<br>So what is the        number of words for the title of long tail keywords       are the most ideal ?, the answer is 4 to 5 words or more, the    longer the title that you create for your blog articles easier it    will be that article a ranking in the search results with a variety    of relevant keywords.<br>If you choose the title of the short tail or short title which only    consists of three syllables or less for keywords with high-level    competition, then your title will be difficult to compete with    blogs on board, because in general the titles of articles composed    of three syllables or less usually been controlled by top blogs    that already has a very good reputation in the eyes of search    engines and already has a long lifespan.<br>Read also:        how to choose the right keywords longtail      </p>
